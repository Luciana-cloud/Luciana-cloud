- 👋 Hi, I’m @Luciana-cloud, a proudly Peruvian postdoc working at the University of California, Irvine.
- 👀 I’m interested in modeling multiscale processes related to litter decomposition that are influenced by soil microbial processes. Previously, I modeled microbial regulated processes limiting pesticide degradation in soils. I am also interested in assessing large-scale processes with satellite images and geographical information systems such as landuse change, erosion, ecosystem services, etc. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python. I worked and coded before with Matlab.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with people interested in digging into microbial processes, climate change, and multiscale modeling.
- 📫 You can reach me at luciana.ch41@gmail.com
